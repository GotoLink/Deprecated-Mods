ShaRose's Deprecated Mods
======

This is basically a dumping ground for mods that I don't want to update anymore. It's basically from me finding the last copy in progressivly older MCP folders that I have (I keep a copy of each workspace just in case).

They should build, but I don't know the operating capacity for them to work. If you wish to update them and release, modified or not, feel free. All I ask is some credit for the base code. Beyond that? I don't really care what you do with it.
